Level Set
First of all, the question is poorly worded. To reply in the negative implies a double negative. The correct wording should be, "Is anything in the room on fire?" which allows the respondent to unambiguously say "yes" or "no".

"Everything" is treated in English grammar as a singular noun, but it always implies plural items. This adds additional confusion to the wording of the question.

When applying negation in the plural, the position of the word "not" is very important. For example, one would say "Not all the things are on fire" to imply that some things may be on fire and somethings may not. Moving the "not" changes meaning of the sentence. In this instance, "All the things are not on fire" is somewhat ambiguous. It could be taken to mean that each and every item is in the state of not being on fire; however, depending on context, one might assume that the speaker is implying that the condition of being on fire doesn't necessarily apply to all items, but maybe some.

For example, if one opened a vegetable drawer and said, "Everything is not rotten." A listener might presume that the speaker was afraid that everything was in fact rotten but was pleasantly surprised to discover that some of the vegetables were in fact edible. That said, the listener might also presume that the speaker started speaking without properly formulating the sentence in their head before speaking, let there mouth outrun their brain and meant to say "Not everything is rotten."

In order to reduce this ambiguity, English has the pronouns "nothing" and "none". An eloquent speaker would say "Nothing is rotten" or "None of the vegetables are rotten" to explicitly state that the state of being rotten does not apply to any of the vegetables.

Grammatical Analysis
The question "Is everything not on fire?" is effectively asking whether the statement "Everything is not on fire" is true or false.

"On fire" is a prepositional phrase which in this case should be interpreted as an adjective.

"Everything" is a singular noun taken to mean the set of all things in a given location.

In this sentence, "is" does not imply equality. "Is" is a copulative verb used to establish that the subject of the sentence (everything) has the qualities of the prepositional phrase.

The real question at the heart of this problem is how to interpret the word "not". There are two possibilities:

"Not" modifies "on fire"
"Not" negates "is"
If "not" modifies "on fire", the sentence is true if and only if none of the items are on fire.

If "not" negates "is", the sentence is true if and only if the sentence "Everything is on fire" is false.

To illustrate the latter case, let us consider the contraction "isn't". Any English speaker would understand "isn't" to be a linguistic simplification equivalent to "is not". However, replacing "is not" with "isn't" shifts the most likely interpretation of the sentence. Now one would presume that "isn't" simply implies the negation of "is". So "Everything isn't on fire" would be inferred to mean "Not all things are on fire" even though it is grammatically equivalent to "Everything is not on fire" which one would be more likely to interpret as "Nothing is on fire".

Conclusion
The question is poorly worded for multiple reasons:

Asking a question in the negative is often confusing. For example, when one asks "Are my keys not on the hook?" A simple "yes" or "no" response does not clearly answer the question.

The speaker clearly wants to know if anything is on fire; therefore, for simplicity and clarity, they should have said "Is anything on fire?" or, as was applicable in the particular case that initiated the discussion, "Have all the fires in the other room been put out?"

As a result, there are two possible conclusions:

Per GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem, it may be impossible to satisfactorily prove the answer to the initial question. However, we are in fact "strange loops" caught inside of this paradox as asserted by Douglas Hofstadter. We are limited by the constraints of this language that we invented to settle the debate, but the language is the source of the confusion and only serves to limit our consciousness and communication.

The only way to break out of this strange loop is to apply the most majestic of philosophical razors: Newton's Flaming Laser Sword. As Mike Adler asserted, "We should not dispute propositions unless they can be shown by precise logic and/or mathematics to have observable consequences. In its strongest form it demands a list of observable consequences and a formal demonstration that they are indeed consequences of the proposition claimed." This debate has no consequences other than to serve as a most insidious form of procrastination from truly worthwhile endeavors.

Therefore, I offer no conclusion and wish I had spent my day in more fruitful endeavors.
